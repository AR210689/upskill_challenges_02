# No-code NLP Challenge
In this challenge you are expected to label a training data set of set messages as 'spam' or 'ham'. Then use a ready jupyter notebook to train a spam detector model. The notebook will automatically save a csv of predictions on a test set.
The challenge has three main steps:
1. Use the jupyter notebook in the repo or use this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11nr_-QKIl19gHHVnBSdZMJPGyENKyaTR#scrollTo=cubUwWgqPCX6).
2. Download the datasets and add your labels to the training dataset in excel using this [link](https://github.com/fellowship/upskill_challenges_02/tree/main/Spam%20or%20Ham/Data). 
3. Export the dataset as csv
4. Upload the dataset into your notebook environment (use this link, for instructions on how to use colab environment).
5. Run the notebook and submit a link to your notebook, training dataset, along with prediction csv
### Instructions
- You will open the dataset and label as much as you want (can)
- The first 100 labels are labeled for you
- The labeling is ‘ham’ or ‘spam’ in the label column in excel -
- Once done with labeling, export training data as csv
- You will upload you training csv and test csv to the colab environment (as show in screenshots in the [doc](https://github.com/fellowship/upskill_challenges_02/blob/main/Spam%20or%20Ham/How%20to%20solve%20NLP%20challenge.pdf))
- Run all the notebook (notebook will automatically download a csv of their predictions)
- Submit a link of your notebook, training dataset, and the csv of your predictions

### Guidelines
- There are about 1000 texts in the training dataset
- First 100 texts are labeled for you
- More labels will increase the accuracy of your model so you are encouraged to label the whole dataset (_however it is not mandatory_)

### Deliverables

Your submission should be a single zip file named **yourfirstname_yourlastname_NLP.csv** containing the following:

- Your **predictions** for test set: A CSV of the corresponding predictions.
- Your **training** data set: A csv of the training set used in the jupiter notebook
- Your **notebook**: Notebook should be downloaded as .ipynb 

## Deadline
[Log in](https://www.launchpad.ai/upskill/levis/login) to your account and upload the public file sharing link via the dashboard. Don't put your file in a folder before compressing; compress the file itself. Challenges should be submitted no later than midnight PST on December 6 for all employees.
