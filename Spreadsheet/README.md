# Spreadsheet Challenge

## Overview

Your goal for this challenge is to perform some data analysis, complete a series of exercises, and summarize your results. You should use Excel to complete the analysis, questions, and present your findings.

## Instructions

The [Excel File](https://github.com/fellowship/upskill_challenges/blob/main/Spreadsheet/Spreadsheet%20Challenge.xlsx) contains all the necessary details. Download the file, rename it _**yourfirstname_yourlastname_excel.xlsx**_, read the instructions, and complete the exercises.

Submit your solution no later than **midnight PST on Sunday, January 31 for corporate employees** and **Friday, February 12 for retail employees**.

## Guidelines

- Don't overwrite your original data, expand it.
- All your work and findings should be in the spreadsheet.
- Summarize your results like you're presenting the findings to key leadership stakeholders.
- Unless otherwise specified, how you present your findings is up to you: numbers, graphs, tables, etc.
