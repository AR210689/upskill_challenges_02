# No-code NLP Challenge
In this challenge you are expected to label a training data set of set messages as 'spam' or 'ham'. Then use a ready jupyter notebook to train a spam detector model. The notebook will automatically save a csv of predictions on a test set.
The challenge has three main steps:
1. Use the jupyter notebook or use this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11nr_-QKIl19gHHVnBSdZMJPGyENKyaTR#scrollTo=cubUwWgqPCX6).
2. Download the datasets and add your labels to the training dataset in excel using this [link](https://github.com/fellowship/upskill_challenges_02/tree/main/Spam%20or%20Ham/Data). 
3. Export the dataset as csv
4. Upload the dataset into your notebook environment (use this link, for instructions on how to use colab environment).
5. Run the notebook and submit a link to your notebook, training dataset, along with prediction csv

### Instructions
- The applicants will open the dataset and label as much as they want (can)
- The labeling is ‘ham’ or ‘spam’ in the label column in excel then  they will export it as csv
- Applicants will upload their csvs to the colab environment (will show in screenshots doc )
- Run the notebook (notebook will automatically  download a csv of their predictions)
- Submit a link of their notebook and the csv of their predictions
