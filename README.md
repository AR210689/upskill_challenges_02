# Challenges

## Overview

Applicants to the Launchpad UpSkill program are required to work on two challenge problems. Each challenge has a distinct focus and will test your problem solving and organization skills. Carefully follow the instructions and pay close attention to the solution submission guidelines; poorly formatted solutions will count against you during the evaluation process.

## Helpful Hints

Although arriving at a functional solution is important, we're more interested in how and why you arrived at your solution. You should be able to summarize and present your work while justifying and explaining the decisions you made along the way. Here are some things you may want to consider while working on your challenges:

- Always look at your data.
- Challenges are not trivial; they should take anywhere from a few hours up to a day to complete.
- Read the instructions and the README.md files, and make sure you have a good understanding of the challenge problem, the data, and the desired solution before you start your work.
- What types of visualizations will help me grasp the nature of the problem? 
- What types of visualizations and summaries will help me present my solution to a key stakeholder?
- What are some of the inherent limitations to my solution, and how can the solution be improved to over come them?
- If there are any, what are some of the business implications relevant to your solution?
